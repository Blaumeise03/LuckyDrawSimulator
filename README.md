# LuckyDrawSimulator
Simulates the drawing of the 'Lucky Draw' event of the game Eve Echoes. The items and weights can be changed at the top of the file main.py. Will procude a table containing the information how often each item was drawn during each round. By default, one million complete drawings of the Lucky Draw wheel will be simulated (for each simulation, all 12 draws will be performed). The amount of simulations can also be changed inside the file main.py.

## Example Result
Each line represents one round of the Lucky Draw and contains the number of how often which item was drawn in this round.
